It is my policy to provide care for your child during contracted hours. The procedure below is to be followed if you fail to collect your child at the appointed time.

<br>

#### Procedure

<br>

##### **If you are running late to collect your child please contact me.**

<br>

If a child is not collected within 20 minutes of the agreed collection time and I have not been contacted with an explanation, I will try calling the parents’ contact numbers.

After 30 minutes, I will try the emergency contact numbers provided on your contract.

During this time, I will continue to safely look after the child.

I will continue to try the parents’ contact numbers and emergency numbers, but if I am unable to make any contact after 1 hour from the original agreed collection time, I have a duty to inform the local authority duty social worker.

I may charge an additional fee for late collection as per my Fees and Admissions policy. In the event of a Terrorist Attack or National Disaster, these rules will not apply.
