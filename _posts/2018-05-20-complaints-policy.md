As a registered Childminder, I aim to work in close partnership with all parents to meet the needs of their children. Maintaining good communication between both parties will aid this. I expect that parents will immediately bring to my attention any aspect of my service they are not happy with so that every effort can be made to resolve the matter. Parents can make a complaint to me verbally, or in writing.

It is a condition of my registration to investigate all written complaints relating to the fulfilment of the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage and/or the Childcare Register. I will notify the complainant of the outcome within 28 days of the receipt of the complaint.

I display Ofsted’s poster for parents, which introduces Ofsted's childcare responsibilities and gives Ofsted contact details.

You can complain or compliment my service to Ofsted by calling: **0300 123 1231**

Or you can write to :  
  Applications, Regulatory and Contact (ARC) Team
  <br>Ofsted  
  Piccadilly Gate  
  Store Street  
  Manchester M1 2WD

#### Procedure

I will investigate all complaints and notify the complainant of the outcomes of the investigation within 28 days.

I will keep a written record of all complaints and their outcome for at least three years. Confidentiality will be maintained but, as required, I will provide Ofsted, on request, with a written record of all complaints within a specified period and the action taken as a result of each complaint.

I will record the following information:
+ The name of the person making the complaint.
+ The Early Years Foundation Stage requirement(s) or Childcare Register
requirements to which the complaint relates.
+ The nature of the complaint.
+ The date and time of the complaint.
+ Any action taken in response to the complaint.
+ The outcome of the complaint investigation (for example, ways the service has
improved).
+ Details of the information and findings that were given to the person making the
complaint, including any action taken.

If the complaint cannot be resolved or if the complaint is of a serious nature and you feel you cannot discuss it with me, please contact Ofsted on **0300 123 1231**.

Ofsted produces guidance on concerns and complaints about childminders and childcare providers. This is available on the [Ofsted website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted){:target="_blank"} and provides guidance on the complainant’s right to contact Ofsted.
