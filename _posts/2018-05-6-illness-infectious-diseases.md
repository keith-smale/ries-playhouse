It is my policy to keep children safe when they are in my care, promote good health and take necessary steps to prevent the spread of infection within my childcare setting and while I am off site.

Please note this policy includes the procedure for COVID-19 as an infectious illness. In the case of a positive case of COVID-19 within my setting, the current government guidelines will be followed in respect of testing within the setting and the isolation period required.

#### Procedures

##### Sickness
If there is a child in my setting who becomes ill whilst in my care, or whom I believe has an infectious illness or disease (for example a severe cold or stomach upset) I will;
+ Contact the parents/guardians to arrange for the immediate collection of the child
+ Ensure the child is excluded from my setting until they have been well for 48 hours,
or in accordance with Health Authority guidelines.

If I believe a child in my setting is suffering from a disease or illness which requires notification to the authorities, I will inform the parents/guardians of my concerns and act on advice given by Public Health England (details of which can be found at [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england){:target="_blank"}) as to when they will be able to return to my setting. I will also inform Ofsted of any action taken.

In accordance with the contract agreed with parents I expect to be paid for the child’s place even if they are excluded from my setting due to an illness or infectious disease.

If I, or one of the members of my family, has a confirmed infectious disease, I will inform parents as soon as I am able. There is no charge for time I am off sick. If this time is already paid for it will either be refunded or deducted from the next month’s invoice.
If a child and I are off sick at the same time, the charge applicable will be reviewed on an individual basis.

I will inform the parents of the other children in my setting if a child I care for has a diagnosed infectious disease.

##### Hygiene

I ensure all adults and children in my setting are aware of good hand-washing procedures, before eating or handling food, after using the toilet and after playing outside.

I ensure there is a supply of tissues available for children.

I immediately clean up any spillage of body fluids using a disposable cloth and gloves.

I ensure that any animals on the premises are safe to be around children and do not pose a health risk.

I ensure that litter trays and pet food dishes are kept away from children.
