It is my policy to keep children safe when they are in my care, promote good health and take necessary steps to prevent the spread of infection within my childcare setting and while I am off site.
Procedures (how I will put the statement into practice)

##### Sick Children
If there is a child in my setting who becomes ill whilst in my care, or whom I believe has an infectious illness or disease (for example a severe cold or stomach upset) I will;
+ Contact the parents as agreed to arrange for the immediate collection of the child
+ Ensure the child is excluded from my setting until they have been well for 48 hours,
or in accordance with Health Authority guidelines.

If I believe a child in my setting is suffering from a disease or illness which requires notification to the authorities, I will inform the parents/guardians of my concerns and act on advice given by Public Health England (details of which can be found at [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england){:target="_blank"}) as to when they will be able to return to my setting. I will also inform Ofsted of any action taken.

I make parents aware of my sickness exclusion policy and keep a record of the arrangements for the exclusion of a child should they become ill whilst in my setting.

In accordance with the contract agreed with parents I expect to be paid for the childâ€™s place even if they are excluded from my setting due to an illness or infectious disease.

If I, or one of the members of my family, has a confirmed infectious disease, I will inform parents as soon as I am able.

As I will not be able to offer my childminding service I do not charge parents for the time the service is unavailable, as agreed in the contract.

I will inform the parents of the other children in my setting if a child I care for has a diagnosed infectious disease.

##### Hygiene

I ensure all adults and children in my setting are aware of good hand-washing procedures, before eating or handling food and after using the toilet.

I ensure there is a supply of tissues available for children.

I immediately clean up any spillage of body fluids using a disposable cloth and gloves.

I ensure that any animals on the premises are safe to be around children and do not pose a health risk.

I ensure that litter trays and pet food dishes are kept away from children.

I have read and understand the illness and infectious diseases policy.
