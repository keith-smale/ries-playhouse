It is my policy to ensure that parents are advised of the fees that I charge and what these fees include and exclude. I aim to make my setting accessible to children and families from the local community through open, fair and clearly communicated policies and procedures.

##### **Provision**

As outlined in the 2017 EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) framework, I am restricted to the number and ages of children that I may care for at any one time. As part of my Ofsted registration I am able to care for six children under the age of 8 years, three of which may be under 5 years old and one of these may be under 1 year old.

I drop off and pick up from the following settings and schools:
+ Ducklings Preschool, Lambeth Road, Eastwood.
+ Eastwood Primary School
+ Eastwood Academy

###### **Opening Hours**

My setting is open during these times:  
  Monday to Friday, 7am to 6pm  

###### **Childcare and Early Education Entitlements**

I offer the following:  
  the universal entitlement for all 3- and 4-year-olds;   
  the extended entitlement for eligible 3- and 4-year-olds with working parents;  
  and the 2-year-old entitlement.  

I offer funded spaces either term time only or using stretched funding – whichever is more appropriate for you.

I claim funding from the local authority for your child after having seen evidence to verify their date of birth at our initial meeting. Parents will be required to fully complete a Parent Declaration Form in order for me to claim any funding and deliver the funded care.

For more information on all entitlements, and to check eligibility criteria please visit [www.childcarechoices.gov.uk](https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk).

###### **Attendance During Funded Sessions**

Please inform me of any reason your child is unable to attend. I am required to monitor your child’s attendance and inform the local authority if attendance falls below 90%.

If you take your child out of my setting during funded hours then I am not required to provide alternative sessions.

###### **Fees**

Hourly rate £5.50

###### **Additional Charges**

I make a charge for certain additional services. These are listed below:
+ consumables (i.e. meals)
+ day trips where an entrance fee is charged

Please note that if you are accessing one of the childcare and early years entitlements, that government funding is not intended to cover the cost of meals, other consumables, additional hours or additional services. If you are only accessing funded hours then these charges are optional and are not a condition of accessing a free place. All additional charges will be itemised on your invoice. If you experience difficulties meeting the cost of these additional services please speak to me.

###### **Occasional Charges**

There may be times that other fees are added to your monthly invoice. These may include:
+ __Late Collection Fee__: £2.75 per 15 minutes of late collection. 
+ __Early Arrival Fee__: £2.75 per 15 minutes.
+ __Late Drop-Off__: There is no fee for late drop-off, although you will be charged the usual rate as per the prior agreed time of drop-off. Please also note if you arrive late, we may be out on the school run and therefore not able to accept your child until we return.
+ __Late Payment Fee__: Your regular payment is due within 7 days of receipt of invoice. Late payment incurs a fee of £5 per day.

###### **Payment**

Payment is required monthly, in advance.
I will invoice you at the beginning of each month, on or around the 1st.
My preferred mode of payment is bank transfer. Details will be on your invoice.

###### **Holidays and Unplanned Absences**

Any holiday I take will not be charged and you will be given 4 weeks’ notice unless there is an emergency.
Parents’ holiday incurs a 50% charge if four weeks’ notice is given. Otherwise, normal fees apply.
Because my setting is closed on bank and public holidays no fee will apply.

If I have to close my setting at short notice, for example because of sickness or emergencies, the following arrangements apply:
+ I have two emergency backup Childminders who may be able to accept your child on short-notice, on a temporary basis.
+ Alternatively, if you decide to make your own arrangements, your fee will therefore not apply and will be refunded in the next month’s fees.

For further information see my illness and infectious diseases policy and/or ask me for details on my emergency backup arrangements, which are listed on my Accident, Incident and Emergency procedures.
