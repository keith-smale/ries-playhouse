This policy explains the taking of photos and video of your child whilst in my care for use with the Tapestry App. For more information see the Tapestry website.

The Tapestry website and smartphone app are a great way to securely share images and video of the development of your child and the activities that we will be doing. I will use the app to also provide developmental details from the EYFS framework in relation to the activity your child was involved in the image or video.
