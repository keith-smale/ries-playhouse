It is my policy to keep children safe on outings whilst in my care.

<br>

#### Procedure 

In order to do this I will ensure that:

The ratio of adults to children on any outing will never be less than 1:6.

I carry out a trial run and risk assessment of proposed outings, noting opening times, timetables for public 
transport/car parking and toilets/nappy changing facilities etc.

I obtain written parental permission for children to take part in regular, local outings whilst in my care and specific written permission for a longer outing.

I take essential records and equipment for each child on outings as necessary, including contact telephone numbers for parents, a first-aid kit and a mobile telephone.

I keep records of my own and any other vehicles in which children are transported, including insurance details and a list of named drivers, which are available to parents.

I will ensure that I and any other driver transporting children in their own vehicle have adequate business insurance cover and age appropriate car safety seats. This also applies to the use of mini cabs.

I make parents aware of what I will do in the event of a lost child.

This policy also links with my accident and emergency procedures and Lost Child policy.
