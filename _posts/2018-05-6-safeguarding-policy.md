As a childminder, I am the lead safeguarding practitioner for my setting.

My first responsibility and priority is towards the children in my care. If I have any cause for concern I will report it to the relevant bodies, following the Southend, Essex and Thurrock (SET) procedures. The local safeguarding board is called **Southend Safeguarding Partnership** and their safeguarding procedures can be found at [www.safeguardingsouthend.co.uk/children](https://www.safeguardingsouthend.co.uk/children){:target="_blank"}.

Our Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) for safeguarding is Allison Francis – 01702 534539

### Training and Procedures

I keep up to date with child protection issues and relevant legislation by taking regular training courses. The date of my last safeguarding training was February, 2021. I also read publications such as, Childcare Professional, a weekly update from NSPCC and keep up to date with local issues raised by the Police, local and national media, and government bodies.

##### Making A Report
Child abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, neglect, domestic, or a mixture of these.   I have regular training on how to spot the signs of abuse and have a duty to refer any signs of abuse to the local authority.
I also have a duty to actively prevent people being drawn into terrorism. This is referred to as “Prevent Duty”. I am aware of the signs and indicators of extremism or radicalisation. If I have any concerns I am obliged to report this at the earliest opportunity.

I must notify Ofsted of any allegations of abuse that are alleged to have taken place while the child is in my care, including any allegations against me, or any members of my family, or other adults or children in my home who have had contact with minded children.

Children will only be released from my care to the parent/carer or to someone named and authorised by them. A password agreed between us might be used to confirm identity if the person collecting the child is not previously known to me. Children will not be released into the care of anyone that I have reason to believe is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or where I feel a child may be in immediate danger.

Parents must notify me of any concerns they have about their child, and any accidents, incidents or injuries affecting the child, which I will record and ask parents to sign.
Unless I believe that it would put the child at risk of further harm, I will discuss concerns with a child’s parent if I notice:

+ significant changes in children's behaviour;
+ deterioration in children’s general well-being;
+ unexplained bruising, marks or signs of possible abuse or neglect;
+ children’s or parents’ comments which give cause for concern, including expressing extremist views;
+ any reasons to suspect neglect or abuse outside the setting, for example in the
child’s home; 
+ and/or inappropriate behaviour displayed by other members of staff, or any person working with children. For example inappropriate sexual comments, excessive one-to one attention beyond the requirements of their usual role and responsibilities, or inappropriate sharing of images.

Where a child fails to attend unexpectedly, I would take all necessary action to attempt to contact their parents. If contact cannot be made after one hour, I will attempt to contact other contacts I have on record for the child and may visit the home of the child. Any unexpected absence will be reported to the Police, or other safeguarding agency according to individual circumstances.

I recognise the additional barriers that exist when recognising the signs of abuse and neglect of children who have special educational needs and/or disabilities.

If a child tells me that they or another child is being abused, I will:
+ Show that I have heard what they are saying, and that I take their allegations seriously.
+ Encourage the child to talk, but I will not prompt them or ask them leading questions. I will not interrupt when a child is recalling significant events and will not make a child repeat their account.
+ Explain what actions I must take, in a way that is appropriate to the age and understanding of the child.
+ Record what I have been told using exact words where possible.
+ Make a note of the date, time, place and people who were present at the discussion.

I will call the local social services’ duty desk on the day of concern for advice and an assessment of the situation. I will follow this phone call up with an email to the Duty team within 48 hours to fct@southend.gcsx.gov.uk . I will record the concern and all contact with Children’s Services thereafter.

If an allegation is made against me, any member of my family, or any other adult or child in my setting I will report it to Ofsted and the Local Authority Designated Officer. I may also contact PACEY’s Helpline on 0300 003 0005 for advice and support.

In all instances of making a referral, I will provide personal details about the relevant child such as full name, date of birth and address in order to assist the relevant safeguarding body to make further investigations to confirm the safety of the child.

I must also ensure that no individual who is unsuitable to work with children has unsupervised access to a child in my care. I have read and understand the safeguarding and welfare requirements of EYFS. I have also read the national statutory guidance document Working Together to Safeguard Children 2015 and What to do if you are Worried a Child is being Abused - Advice for Practitioners 2015. I have also read and understand the Ofsted safeguarding guidance – Inspecting Safeguarding in Early Years, Education and Skills settings.

###### **The Use of Mobile Phones and Cameras**

I understand that mobile phones are an everyday part of life for parents and childminders and with that in mind have laid out my procedure for their use:
+ I will ensure my mobile phone is fully charged and with me at all times in case of emergencies.
+ I have the facility to take photographs on both my mobile phone and camera and will seek your permission to take any photographs of your child to record activities and share their progress with you.
+ I will not publish any photographs of your child's face on any social networking sites or share with any other person without your permission.

I request that you do not use your mobile phone whilst dropping off and collecting your child.

Any visitors to the setting will also be asked not to use their mobile phone.

If your child has a mobile phone, games console etc with camera facilities that they wish to bring into the setting please let me know. This is so that we can work together for the safety of all children in attendance and ensure appropriate access to material when using the internet.

In order to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 I have registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office as a data controller. Any information or photographs taken of children in my care are for the sole use of recording their development and for liaising with parents.
