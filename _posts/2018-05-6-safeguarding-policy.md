As a childminder, I am the lead safeguarding practitioner for my setting.

My first responsibility and priority is towards the children in my care. If I have any cause for concern I will report it to the relevant bodies, following the Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) procedures. The name of our LSCB is the **Southend-on-Sea Local Safeguarding Children Board** and the LSCB procedures can be found at [www.safeguardingsouthend.co.uk/children](www.safeguardingsouthend.co.uk/children).

Our Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) for safeguarding is Allison Francis – 01702 534539

I understand that child abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, neglect, domestic, or a mixture of these, and I am aware of the signs and symptoms of these.

I am aware that I must have **due regard to the need to prevent people being drawn into terrorism**. This is referred to in the Prevent Duty. I am also aware of the signs and indicators of extremism or radicalisation. If I had any concerns I would contact the Prevent Officer in my local area my LSCB as above.

I am aware of the Department for Education telephone helpline (020 7340 7264) to enable staff and governors to raise concerns relating to extremism directly. Concerns can also be raised by email to [counter.extremism@education.gsi.gov.uk].(mailto:counter.extremism@education.gsi.gov.uk)

I must notify Ofsted of any allegations of abuse that are alleged to have taken place while the child is in my care, including any allegations against me, or any members of my family, or other adults or children in my home who have had contact with minded children.

I must also ensure that no individual who is unsuitable to work with children has unsupervised access to a child in my care. I have read and understand the safeguarding and welfare requirements of EYFS. I have also read the national statutory guidance document *Working Together to Safeguard Children 2015* and *What to do if you are Worried a Child is being Abused - Advice for Practitioners 2015*. I have also read and understand the Ofsted safeguarding guidance – *Inspecting Safeguarding in Early Years, Education and Skills settings*.

#### Procedure
I keep up to date with child protection issues and relevant legislation by taking regular training courses. The date of my last training was May, 2018 and by reading relevant publications for example, *Childcare Professional*.

I follow the procedures outlined in my confidentiality policy. I aim to share all information with parents but in some instances (where I am worried about a child’s wellbeing) I may have to refer concerns without discussing this with you.

I work together with parents to make sure the care of their child is consistent – please refer to my Working with Parents policy.

Children will only be released from my care to the parent/carer or to someone named and authorised by them. A password agreed between us might be used to confirm identity if the person collecting the child is not previously known to me. Children will not be released into the care of anyone that I have reason to believe is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Parents must notify me of any concerns they have about their child, and any accidents, incidents or injuries affecting the child, which I will record and ask parents to sign.
Unless I believe that it would put the child at risk of further harm, I will discuss concerns with a child’s parent if I notice:

+ significant changes in children's behaviour;
+ deterioration in children’s general well-being;
+ unexplained bruising, marks or signs of possible abuse or neglect;
+ children’s or parents’ comments which give cause for concern, including expressing extremist views;
+ any reasons to suspect neglect or abuse outside the setting, for example in the
child’s home; and/or inappropriate behaviour displayed by other members of staff, or any person working with children. For example inappropriate sexual comments, excessive one-to one attention beyond the requirements of their usual role and responsibilities, or inappropriate sharing of images.

I will ensure I have at least three relevant contacts for the child, so that I have alternative contact details in the case of unexpected absences.
Where the child fails to attend unexpectedly, I would take all necessary action to attempt to contact their parents. If contact cannot be made after one hour, I will visit the home of the child. Any unexpected absence will be reported to the Police, or other safeguarding agency according to individual circumstances.

I recognise the additional barriers that exist when recognising the signs of abuse and neglect of children who have special educational needs and/or disabilities.

If a child tells me that they or another child is being abused, I will:
+ Show that I have heard what they are saying, and that I take their allegations seriously.
+ Encourage the child to talk, but I will not prompt them or ask them leading questions. I will not interrupt when a child is recalling significant events and will not make a child repeat their account.
+ Explain what actions I must take, in a way that is appropriate to the age and understanding of the child.
+ Record what I have been told using exact words where possible.
+ Make a note of the date, time, place and people who were present at the discussion.

I will call the local social services’ duty desk on 01702 215870/534496 on the day of concern for advice and an assessment of the situation.

I will follow this phone call up with an email to the Duty team within 48 hours to fct@southend.gcsx.gov.uk . I will record the concern and all contact with Children’s Services thereafter.

If an allegation is made against me, any member of my family, or any other adult or child in my setting I will report it to Ofsted/my Childminding Agency and the Local Authority designated officer or team of officers, following the Local Safeguarding Children Board procedures. I will also contact PACEY’s Helpline on 0300 003 0005 for advice and support.

In all instances I will record:
+ the child’s full name and address
+ the date and time of the record
+ factual details of the concern, for example bruising, what the child said, who was present
+ details of any previous concerns
+ details of any explanations from the parents
+ any action taken such as speaking to parents.

**It is not my responsibility to attempt to investigate the situation myself.**

###### **The Use of Mobile Phones and Cameras**

I understand that mobile phones are an everyday part of life for parents and childminders and with that in mind have laid out my procedure for their use:
+ I will ensure my mobile phone is fully charged and with me at all times in case of emergencies.
+ I have the facility to take photographs on both my mobile phone and camera and will seek your permission to take any photographs of your child to record activities and share their progress with you.
+ Any photographs taken will be deleted after either emailing to you or printed for use in your child’s learning journey
+ I will not publish any photographs of your child on any social networking sites or share with any other person without your permission.

I request that you do not use your mobile phone whilst dropping off and collecting your child.

Any visitors to the setting will also be asked not to use their mobile phone.

If your child has a mobile phone, games console etc with camera facilities that they wish to bring into the setting please let me know. This is so that we can work together for the safety of all children in attendance and ensure appropriate access to material when using the internet.

In order to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 I have registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office as a data controller to allow me to store digital images on an SD card device/computer.
