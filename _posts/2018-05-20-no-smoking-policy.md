It is my policy to ensure that children are in a smoke-free environment whilst in my care.

<br>

#### Procedure

I will ensure that:

No-one smokes in any room where the children in my care are present or about to be present, either in my home or in any other setting.

My home is a non-smoking home and I will ensure that any visitors to my home smoke outside and away from the children. This includes the garden â€“ i.e. there will be no smoking allowed in the garden whilst I have children at the premises.

Where reasonably possible I will ensure that no-one smokes in an outside play area when the children in my care are present or about to be present (although this may be difficult, for example at a public park).

If, in exceptional circumstances, the children in my care are expected to use any space that has been used for smoking then I will ensure that there is adequate ventilation to clear the atmosphere.
