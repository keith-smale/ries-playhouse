When we walk up to Marie's every morning we can hear children giggling inside! Marie opens the door and my son is already beaming and wanting to be handed over. I was nervous about leaving my first born baby with someone else but Marie allayed all of my worries and fears. She keeps us updated and pulls together fun activities that I would simply NEVER think of, so I know my son's life is being enriched by her. We met with a number of childminders but Marie was an instant 'yes' for us.</em> <span class="oi oi-double-quote-serif-right"></span></p>
